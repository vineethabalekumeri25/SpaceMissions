    ```

2. This will generate a `launches_per_year.png` and `cost_per_year.png` file in the `output` directory.

## Features

- Analyze the number of launches per year.
- Visualize the average cost of space missions over the years.
- Output charts saved as `.png` files in the `output` directory.
